# Partial-Sensing
This is the second project of the course, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick.

In this project, we used python version 3.8.11 and conda version 4.8.3.

The assignment file contains the problem description and the report file contains the generated results. Also, we have added one file named "Description of Project Structure.txt" where you can get how the project is organised.
